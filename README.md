## Goals
The Farmbot web app is an application that is used to monitor the physiological condition of plants in a farm plot by analyzing data obtained from the FarmBot sensors, and includes an alert system that allow users to know about plants that may be in danger.

## Inspiration
The initial inspiration for our application came from observing the FarmBots on top of the student pavilion at the University of Melbourne which inspired us to transform it into a digital 3D visualisation, After viewing many visual apps and gardening games, we considering the design of the garden simulator game to be a closer representation of the design of our application.

Garden Simulator is a game that involves the simulation of planting, sowing and harvesting plants. However, the realistic art style in Garden Simulator might be hard to implement
